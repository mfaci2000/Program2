Modify your program so that it only accepts numbers between 0 and 127.
Once you get a valid number, display the ascii character of that number.

For example, if you user enters the number 115, your program would display
 number 115 corresponds to ASCII character 's'

NOTE: Make sure to finish your school homework firdt, then work on your
programming assignments :)
